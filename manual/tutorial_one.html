            Welcome to the first tutorial in our series on using <a href="https://shiplab.github.io/vesseljs/" target="_blank">vessel.js</a>
            – a powerful JavaScript library that combines the principles of data-driven 
            design with a web-based, object-oriented approach for conceptual ship design and simulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This first tutorial will show you how to create a simple 3D ship
            using the vessels.js library. After the tutorial you you'll 
            be equipped with the knowledge to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand the fundamentals of vessels.js and its JSON database format.
            </li>
            <li>Import a ship's design from a JSON file.</li>
            <li>Integrate your ship into a Three.js scene for 3D visualization.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="lower_bar">
            <h1><b>Getting Started:</b></h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            A creation can be divided into three steps, the import of the library, 
            the load of the vessels.js JSON format and the insertion on the ship:
          </p>

          <pre class="prettyprint showlinemods lang-js">
// Importing the Library
import * as Vessel from "../build/vessel.module.js"

// Loading the Ship's Design JSON file
const ship = new Vessel.Ship("./blockCase.json")

// Creating the Ship3D module and adding it to a Scene
ship.createShip3D({
  stlPath: "../examples/3D_models/STL/various",
})

// scene object derived from the Three.js library
scene.add(ship.ship3D);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The Ship method points toward a JSON file that contains the vessel 
            information in the Vessel.js format. On <a href="#anchor-json-format-section">JSON Format section</a>
            we will discuss more about the Vessel.js format. For this example the 
            <code>blockCase.json</code> file was initialized with the <code>Vessel.Ship</code>
            method.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scene object is part of the Three.js library and it is used for displaying the
            3D visualization. For a detailed explanation of how scenes work, please refer to the main
            documentation at <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene" target="_blank">https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene</a>. 
          </p>

          <p>The following visualization shows how should be the visualization for the scene:</p>

            <h1><b>JSON Format</b></h1>            
          </div>
          Vessel.js employs a JSON format to store the design of the ship. 
          The JSON file is segmented into four sections, namely:
          <code>designState</code>, <code>structure</code>, <code>baseObjects</code> and <code>derivedObjects</code>.
          Presented here is a sample of a JSON file along with its data functions:          

          <pre class="prettyprint showlinemods lang-js">
{
  "designState": {
    // Holds several parameters that affect calculations
  },
  "structure": {
    // Definition of the hull, decks and bulkheads
  },
  "baseObjects": [
    // Array of base objects as it is fetched from the provided specification.
    // It groups several compartments elements,
    // for example (cargo holds, tanks, ballast tanks, etc.)
  ],
  "derivedObjects": [
    // Array of derived objects. A derived object is a base object
    // with information added on top of it. Derived objects are classified
    // as parts of baseObjects.
  ]
}         
          </pre>

    <h2><b>designState</b></h2>

    The <code>designState</code> section contains several parameters that affect the calculations
    such as tank fillings. The object can be subdivided in two sections: 
    <code>calculationParameters</code> and <code>objectOverrides</code>.
    Here is as simple example of a designState object format:

    <pre class="prettyprint showlinemods lang-js">
"designState": {
  "calculationParameters": {
    "LWL_design": 22.5,
    "BWL": 10,
    "Draft_design": 2,
    "Cb_design": 1,
    "speed": 12,
  },
  "objectOverrides": {
    "derivedByGroup": {
      "cargo tanks": {
        "fullness": 0
      },
      "ballast tanks": {
        "fullness": 1
      }
    }
  }
},       
    </pre>
    
    <p>
    The <code>calculationParameters</code> comprise a collection of 
    specified ship parameters used for calculations. 
    Certain parameters, such as LWL and Cb, can be calculated from
    load and hull geometry, while others are uncertain or not covered by existing calculations.
    For a full list of parameters information that can be stored
    in this list please refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/shiplab/vesseljs/wiki/API-Reference#calculationparameters" target="_blank">Wiki (calculationParameters)</a>
    .
    </p>
    <p>
    The <code>objectOverrides</code> assign state information to a specific set of base object groups.
    This example shows a set of objects overrides for the "cargo tanks" and "ballast tanks".
    For a full overview of the object overrides types please refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/shiplab/vesseljs/wiki/API-Reference#objectoverrides" target="_blank">Wiki (objectOverrides)</a>
    .
    </p>

    <h2><b>structure</b></h2>
    A ship structure consists of a hull, decks and bulkheads.
    The specification below defines a barge ship with a simple prismatic hull,
    one deck and one bulkhead. The hull is defined with a table of offsets,
    and the library creates a tessellated surface to cover the points on the table.
    The properties waterlines and stations define the position of the sections as 
    fractions of the LOA and Depth, respectively. 
    The points on the table are defined for one symmetry 
    side of the hull. The arrays on the table define the 
    waterlines, from lowest to highest. Each point in an array 
    is associated to one station, from last to foremost.

    <pre class="prettyprint showlinemods lang-js">
"structure": {
  "hull": {
    "attributes": {
      "LOA": 22.5,
      "BOA": 10,
      "Depth": 2.5,
      "APP": 0
    },
    "halfBreadths": {
      "waterlines": [0, 0, 1],
      "stations": [0, 1],
      "table": [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
    },
    "buttockHeights": {},
    "affiliations": {
      "SBSD": "Hull",
      "group": "structure"
    }
  },
  "decks": {
    "BallastTop": {
      "zFloor": 0.4,
      "thickness": 0.01,
      "xAft": 0,
      "xFwd": 22.5,
      "yCentre": 0,
      "breadth": 10,
      "density": 7850,
      "affiliations": {
        "SBSD": "Hull",
        "group": "structure"
      }
    }
  },
  "bulkheads": {
    "AB": {
      "xAft": 11.25,
      "thickness": 0.01,
      "density": 7850,
      "affiliations": {
        "SBSD": "Hull",
        "group": "structure"
      }
    }
  }
}     
    </pre>

    For a full explanation about the <code>structure</code> section
    please refer to the tutorial in <a href="https://observablehq.com/@icarofonseca/hull-definition-and-hydrostatics" target="_blank">
    https://observablehq.com/@icarofonseca/hull-definition-and-hydrostatics</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/shiplab/vesseljs/wiki/API-Reference#structure" target="_blank">Wiki (Structure)</a>

    <h2><b>baseObjects and derivedObjects</b></h2>

    The <code>baseObjects</code> and <code>derivedObjects</code> define the equipment, tanks and compartments of the ship.
    On the base object it is possible to group several object states into a single supergroup.
    For instance, a cargo hold can be divided into several compartments, each one with a different state.
    Here is an example for the <code>baseObjects</code> for a specific cargo hold type:

    <pre class="prettyprint showlinemods lang-js">
"baseObjects": [
{
  "id": "cargo",
  "affiliations": {},
  "boxDimensions": {
    "length": 10.25,
    "breadth": 9,
    "height": 1.6
  },
  "capabilities": {},
  "baseState": {
    "fullness": 0
  },
  "weightInformation": {
    "contentDensity": 850,
    "volumeCapacity": 145,
    "lightweight": 10000,
    "fullnessCGMapping": {
      "fullnesses": [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1],
      "cgs": [
        [0, 0, 0.8],
        [0, 0, 0.347013783],
        [0, 0, 0.455846422],
        [0, 0, 0.6195241],
        [0, 0, 0.8]
      ]
    }
  }
}]
    </pre>

    This object can be connect to a specific <code>derivedObjects</code>
    allowing the compartment to inherit the specifications from the 
    <code>baseObjects</code> group. Here is an example for a 
    so called a cargo "Tank1" derived tank:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint showlinemods lang-js">
"derivedObjects": [
  {
    "id": "Tank1",
    "baseObject": "cargo",
    "affiliations": {
      "SBSD": "Liquid and dry bulk cargo",
      "group": "cargo tanks",
      "Deck": "CargoDeck",
      "SFI": "102"
    },
    "referenceState": {
      "xCentre": 16.875,
      "yCentre": 0,
      "zBase": 0.4
    }
  ]      
    </pre>
