This tutorial introduces the best practices for using the [vessel.js](https://github.com/shiplab/vesseljs); a JavaScript library for data-driven design combining conceptual ship design with a web-based object-oriented approach.

The solution is described in H.M. Gaspar's paper: 

  [***Vessel.js: an open and collaborative ship design object-oriented library***](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/shiplab/vesseljs/files/IMDC_preprint.pdf).

As the tutorial progresses, the following design steps will be covered:

* Detailing a ship general arrangement and lines plan;
* Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a system engineering approach; 
* Displaying a 3D rendering of the ship hosted on a web platform;
* Explanation about main analysis and simulation models.

The research ship [Gunnerus](https://www.ntnu.edu/gunnerus) is used as a model in each of the digitalization process steps.

This project was possible thanks to several partners that helped me to achieve a high standard report. First, I would like to acknowledge the importance of [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) for financing this project, providing the 3D models and investing in my capacitation as student. This support will definitely help me in my career and contribute to the improvement of technological collaborative solutions. 

  

Seccond, I would like to thank my professor and coordinator [Henrique M. Gaspar](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/henrique.gaspar) for guiding me through the several tasks I had and for fostering between the students the usage and development of the library [Vessel.js](https://shiplab.github.io/vesseljs/).  

  

The development of this report was also very smooth thanks to the several [examples](https://observablehq.com/collection/@icarofonseca/vessel-js) and snippets provided by [√çcaro Fonseca](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/icaro.a.fonseca) and all previews students partners, which together with this report becomes the main guide for [Vessel.js](https://shiplab.github.io/vesseljs/) usage. The leverage potential of the applications provided by this report can be close related not only with the developer partners inside NTNU but also thanks to the huge open source community which this project relies on. 

Finally I would like to acknowledge [Mario Delgado](https://observablehq.com/@mariodelgadosr) for improving [Chapter 1](./chapter-2/index.html) and [Section 2.1](../chapter-2/index.html), making the report more friendly for non maritime professionals and improving the 3D hull visualization.
